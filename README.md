English is my second language, I try may best to avoid any mistakes, 
but if there any, leave a message, you will be appreicated.

# IIECON.CZ

This site is my web project for my blog and stuff.

The domain of this site means "I love economics". The second "I" stands
for "love", which sounds like "çˆ±"(love) in Chinese.

I built it with the python web framework Flask, served by Gunicorn, 
reverse proxied by nginx.

For the time being I host my site at SugarHosts. If it works fine, 
I will host the site there for the following days.

## xtu.308.iiecon.cz

Under this subdomain, I host my pages for the office 308 in business 
school, xtu.

Temporally, users can sign in, hen post blogs or comments below other's 
blogs.

I recommend users putting articles about Economics or their serious
thoughts to this site, but other funny stories are not limited.

I truly want to make a site that someone will enjoy, even useful,
inspiring.

## panel.iiecon.cz

This part of the site is for presenting statistic numbers which some 
people may concern.

I divided this part into Global, China and so on. In each different
section, the web page will display some tables and charts that matters
for our research.

The part will be under development for a long time.
