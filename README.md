English is my second language, I try my best to avoid mistakes, 
but if there any, leave a message, I will appreciate it.

# IIECON.CZ

This site is a web project for my blog and other stuff.

The domain means "I love economics". The second "I" stands
for "love", which sounds like "çˆ±"(love) in Chinese.

I built it with the python web framework Flask, served by Gunicorn, 
reverse proxied by nginx.

For the time being I host my site at SugarHosts. If nothing bad happened, 
I will host the site there for the following days.

## xtu.308.iiecon.cz

Under this subdomain, I host my pages for the office 308 in business 
school, xtu.

Temporally, users can sign in, post blogs or comments.

I recommend users putting articles about Economics or their serious
thoughts on this site, but other funny stories are also welcome.

I truly want to make a site which is joyful, even useful,
and inspiring.

## panel.iiecon.cz

This part of the site is for presenting statistic numbers which some 
people may concern.

I divided this part into Global, China and so on. In each different
section, the web page will display some tables and charts that matters
for our researches.

The part will be under development for a long time.
