I started another python project for my personal blog websit. After several searchings on google, I decided to use FlatPages to create my blog. At the beginning I thought I can use a package called Flask-FlatPages-Pandoc to render my markdown documents directly to html files. Unfortunately, after I've tried several times, I still couldn't render the webpages correctly. Finally, I quitted using Flask-FlatPages-Pandoc as the renderer, instead, I went to find other JavaScript packages to render math notation and highlight syntax.

Now, I have drafted the online blog, but the look of this site is ugly, I need time to polish.
